# BOOTSTRAP is used to have make ignore sections of make code like:
# -include $(SRCS:.cpp=.d) tdriver.d. Make will try to generate the .d
# files if they don't exist since we typically have a rule that says
# how to do that.  That involves processing header files and we don't
# want the success of the clean operation to fail because of missing
# headers.
